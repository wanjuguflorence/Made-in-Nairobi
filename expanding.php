	    		<li><h1>What do these companies have in common?</h1></li>

	    		<ol>
	    			<li>They are mostly coded in Nairobi</li>
	    		    <li>They have more people user or visit their site monthy</li>
	    		    <li>They display "Made in Nairobi " as prominently as its copyright and links to this page- http://community.ihub.co.ke/</li>

	    		</li>

	    		<li>
	    			<h1>What does "mostly coded in Nairobi" mean?</h1>
	    			<p>Over 50% of the front and backend code for the website or application was written in Nairobi.</p>
	    		</li>

                 <li>
	    			<h1>How do you verify that participants meet the "mostly coded in Nairobi" and "10K+ people" rules?</h1>
	    			<p>For now, honor system. Maybe later, verification TBD. Violations will be made public.</p>
	    		</li>

	    		<li>
	    			<h1>My company is based in Nairobi but our technology is mostly made (coded) elsewhere. Can we be listed?</h1>
	    			<p>No. Many great companies and projects are certainly being conceived and managed and funded in Nairobi, but that doesnt mean they are made in Nairobi. This is for internet that are made in NRB.</p>
	    		</li>

	    		<li>
	    			<h1>Why the strict "mostly coded in NRB" rule?</h1>
	    			<p>Because tech is coded, so made means made. Made doesnt mean funded or managed. Like a shirt thats designed/licensed/funded in Ethiopia, and made in Tanzani: Its Made in Sudan, not Made in Uganda. Made means made.</p>
	    		</li>

	    		<li>
	    			<h1>Is there a Made in Nairobi logo that we can display?</h1>
	    			<p>We dont have an official logo, but see "Adverb or verb? What kind of adverb or verb?" for what you should display on your site</p>
	    		</li>

	    		<li>
	    			<h1>What's the point?</h1>
	    			<p>If Nairobi is to thrive in the 21st century, NRB needs to make more internet. Thankfully and excitingly, NRB is now (2011) finally making some of the best internet in the world
